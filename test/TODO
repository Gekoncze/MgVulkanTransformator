### SOON
    there might be problems with static native method calls - would require static library loading always... better would be on Vk creation! for possible error handling or custom library name or something

### NOW
    Vulkan level implementation
        pair handles with related functions
            create / destroy functions into auto-closeable classes
            other related functions

### DONE
Vulkan level implementation PART #12
    added check for null in vulkan functions
    made vulkan create functions return new instance
    made vulkan enumerate functions return new array instance
