### SOON
    change entity.Pointer.Array to be just entity.Array.Array (then Pointer would be redundant... maybe!)
        if possible
        for structure getters could be lil difficult with .Array version ...

    simplified structure setters
        simplify structure setters for arrays ???
            need to detect if previous field name ends with count + current field name should start with p and next letter should be capital
            special case for string array - current field name starts with pp

### NOW
    simplify vk functions some more - like structure setters!
    add repository folders for different versions of mgvulkan
