### SOON

### NOW
    there might be problems with static native method calls - would require static library loading always... better would be on Vk creation! for possible error handling or custom library name or something
    decide if to keep "Vk" or "Vulkan" as core name for simplified interface

### DONE
Complete rebuild + cleanup + simplifications
    abandoned vulkan oop layer (will be as separate library)
    too much to type
    added simplified vulkan interface
