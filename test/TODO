### LATER MAYBE
    change entity.Pointer.Array to be just entity.Array.Array (then Pointer would be redundant... maybe!)
        if possible
        for structure getters could be lil difficult with .Array version ...

### NOW


### DONE
improvements for possibly better performance
    made native methods protected
    added direct value getters and setters for system type arrays
