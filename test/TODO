### NOW


    change entity.Pointer.Array to be just entity.Array.Array (then Pointer would be redundant... maybe!)
        if possible

    simplified structure setters
        for all struture like entities added simplified setters
        we could simplify VkChar too as String, but then would need to use different set ... !
        for getters could be lil difficult with .Array version ...
        simplify structure setters for arrays
            need to detect if previous field name ends with count + current field name should start with p and next letter should be capital
            special case for string array - current field name starts with pp

    simplify vk functions some more - like structure setters!

### DONE
major changes part #2
    added specs constructors for some basic structures
