### SOON


### NOW
    Vulkan level implementation
        pair handles with related functions
            create / destroy functions into auto-closeable classes
            detect functions with Device as first parameter and current entity handle as second parameter

    get rid of get/set value in handle, aswell as constructors
    make vulkan create functions return new instance
    make vulkan enumerate functions return new array instance

### DONE
Vulkan level implementation PART #11
    added parameter (entities) for translators for gen method
    removed useless documentation - it is lost when exported to jar ... -.-
    put back handle arrays
    added vulkan core translator + templates (not complete yet though)
    implemented simple logic for pairing handles with their constructors, destructors and other related functions
    prepared handles for further oop simplifications
