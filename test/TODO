### SOON
    change entity.Pointer.Array to be just entity.Array.Array (then Pointer would be redundant... maybe!)
        if possible
        for structure getters could be lil difficult with .Array version ...

### NOW
    simplify vk functions some more - like structure setters!

    simplified structure setters
        simplify structure setters for arrays ???
            need to detect if previous field name ends with count + current field name should start with p and next letter should be capital
            special case for string array - current field name starts with pp



### DONE
major changes part #3
    fixed major issue with values passed as null - sink address was used instead of null address
    for all struture like entities added simplified setters
    fixed merging of vk and vk simplifed... that actually didnt merge ._."
