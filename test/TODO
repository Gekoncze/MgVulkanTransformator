### LATER MAYBE
    change entity.Pointer.Array to be just entity.Array.Array (then Pointer would be redundant... maybe!)
        if possible
        for structure getters could be lil difficult with .Array version ...

### NOW


### DONE
pointer, function pointer and array improvements
    replaced java adition of pointers with native (hopefully safer) implementation
    wrapped some array code in addressAt method
    fixed constructor for constant arrays to use setValueAt
    added getValueAt and setValueAt to pointer array
    removed boolean from VkBool32
    made more native methods protected instead of private
    renamed native methods to have Native suffix (excluding public ones)
    added VkChar.Array specialization
    multiple fixes in VkString
